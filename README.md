# pycli
A python based Command line interface by me <br>
``` chat> ```<br>
chat> is the initial component of the syntax. The best command to use as of now is exit, which will exit the CLI
- exit - Exit the CLI, close program
- hello - Say hello
- rizz_me - Find a romantic partner and then realize they're on a screen
- math - Enter Maths section

``` chat>math> ``` <br>
math> is the part reserved for maths based commands
- add (numbers) - Add numbers (currently only integers)
- exit - return to chat> 

<br><br>

## future features
- multiply
- math>trig> (sin, cos, atan, etc.)
- filesystem (local use only, directory control)
- ping (internet access)
- http get (API Access, idk why not)
