# pycli
A python based Command line interface by me
``` chat> ```
chat> is the initial component of the syntax. The best command to use as of now is exit, which will exit the CLI
- exit - Exit the CLI, close program
- hello - Say hello
- rizz_me - Find a romantic partner and then realize they're on a screen
- math - Enter Maths section

``` chat>math> ```
math> is the part reserved for maths based commands
- add (numbers) - Add numbers (currently only integers)
- exit - return to chat>
